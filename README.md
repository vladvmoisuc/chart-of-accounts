I've created this project because I wanted to understand better the OOP principles in Javascript. Researching led me to the fact that there isn't any project online like this, so I was more motivated to deploy it. Using a printed chart of accounts is a hassle. You have to swap pages, turn them around, search the accounts one by one. It's just too much work.

It implements a simple design, having the search bar on the top, followed by the displayable items. 

For the search function, I've implemented a recursive function that takes the user input and splits it by words. It searches if the account includes a certain word/words or number/numbers and then return the matching options. 

I've used HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and Javascript.
